// Run commands like push are being mostly used
// Users can access the first and last elements
// There are less actions than linked list and hash tables

// Stacks => functions: lookup O(n), pop O(1), push O(1), peek O(1)
//      LIFO: Last in first out
//      Most languages have stack
//      Example: Browser history, writing text and undo option

//Queues => functions : lookup O(n) , enqueu O(1) , dequeue O(1) , peek O(1)
//      FIFO: first in first out
//      Frequently asked in interviews
//      Example: Printer: sorts the task by order
//      Inefficient, when remove first element shifting data
